% Future Work Section

Although the current CircusTent infrastructure supports a number of modern programming models, we would like to further expand this set of models to better support heterogeneous platforms that include diverse components such as GPUs and FPGAs.
This will require adding support for the OpenMP \textit{target} construct and/or inclusion of additional backends such as OpenACC or CUDA-based implementations.
Alternatively, a more holistic approach could be applied through integration of a modern heterogeneous compilation and runtime infrastructure such as SYCL~\cite{10.1145/3204919.3204930}.  

In addition to the aforementioned heterogeneous system infrastructure, we also seek to expand our benchmark evaluation to include distributed memory platforms and programming models.
Given the current support for MPI and OpenSHMEM, it would be advantageous to execute CircusTent on a variety of interconnects (Infiniband, Cray Aries, Ethernet) at scale in order to derive the performance parameters of atomic memory operations for large-scale system deployments.   

Finally, as parallel programming models continue to evolve and adapt to new system architectures, we will continually update the current CircusTent backend implementations to exploit the latest in programming model optimizations.
Further, we fully expect to continue developing new programming model backends for CircusTent in order to evaluate additional models for future scalable systems.
